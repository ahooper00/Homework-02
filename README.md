# Homework-02

*Updated Portfolio Page*

This homework task involved building on a portfolio website that had been created early on in my coding course. 
It primarily uses HTML and advanced CSS skills acquired throughout the duration of the course thus far, including flexbox and pseudo classes. 
This portfolio page has links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Email.
The page also has a small description of myself and why I am pursuing programming.
2 of my deployed application have been showcased, with links to the corresponding application and GitHub repository.
An updated resume (with some personal information hidden) is available with newly acquired programming skills.
