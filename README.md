# MY PORTFOLIO

*Updated Portfolio Page*

## Description
This portfolio page is designed to showcase the work I have doing over the course of this 6 month bootcamp. It is an opportunity to display what I have accomplished throughout this course, and demonstrate the skills that I have acquired visually.
This portfolio page has links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and email, as well as links to different pieces of work.
The page also has a small description of myself and why I am pursuing programming.
An updated resume (with some personal information hidden) is available with newly acquired programming skills.
