# Homework-02

This homework task involved building a portfolio website from scratch, using HTML and advanced CSS skills acquired the past 2 weeks, including flexbox and pseudo classes. As I am early into my programming learning, I do not have many skills to showcase. However I will be building on and adding to this portfolio throughout the duration of (and beyond) this course. The navigation links for my contact details are navigate to actual links, however the sections for different topics (eg, basic web development, javascript) do not have anything to link to yet. 
Hopefully, my design skills will improve with practise!
