      <p class="bio">Currently working in the biotechnology industry, I am studying programming to broaden my
        skillset and challenge myself with something new.
        I am working towards being a competent web developer, as well as have a broad understanding of backend
        development. I am hoping to eventually merge my science
        expertise with my newly developed programming skills, potentially in the field of bioinformatics, or something
        else that I have not even heard of!
        Follow this porfolio as I explore the wide world of programming and showcase these skills bit by bit!

          I have completed my first group project through the coding bootcamp. This project, titled 'Parody Pumper',
          required the use of multiple
          third party APIs
          to create a front-end responsive and interactive application.

          <p class="box-text">
            Node.js is used in Javascript and enables development of fast web servers by bringing event-driven
            programming to web servers.
            </br>
            A project I have created uses Node.js to create a team profile. This team profile builder is a
            command-line-input application
            that uses Node.js to run. It requests information about a software engineering team, and generates an HTML
            webpage displaying
            a summary for each team member. Once the application is launched in the command-line, the user is presented
            with a series of prompts.
            The user can choose the type of employee they want to input - Manager, Engineer, or Intern. Further prompts
            request information about
            the employee including email, ID, and GitHub. The user can input as many employees as they like, and once
            finished, an HTML page is
            generated displaying the employees and information from the user. Find the GitHub repo <a
              href="https://github.com/ahooper00/team-profile-builder" alt="link to repo"><strong>HERE</strong></a> and
            see how to run the application yourself!

        <h2>SQL</h2>
        <p class="box-text">
          MySQL is an open-sources, relational, database management system based on SQL - Structured Query Language. It
          is used for storing
          and managing data, e-commerce, and applications.
          </br>
          I have used mySQL for a number of projects involving the storing and managing of data. I have created a
          command-line-input
          application that allows a business owner to view employees, departments and roles in the company. The user can
          simply view
          departments, employees and the roles available in a company, and also update employee roles. It uses Node.js
          to run, and mysql to
          store company data. This application utilises CRUD (create, read, update, delete) to handle the data in mySQL.
          To run the application
          yourself, <a href="https://github.com/ahooper00/employee-tracker-mysql" alt="link to repo"><strong>follow this
              link</strong></a> to my

          their own account, and record all the medications they need to take and for how long. Users will be able to record the name of
          the medication, time they need to take it, how long they need to take it for, their dosage and any further instructions
          required. They will be greeted with the medications for the day, and any meds upcoming.
